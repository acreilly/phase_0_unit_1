## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* I had Mac OS X 10.6.8 so I was unable to download the app, but I upgraded to Maverick so that is not an issue anymore. I was skeptical because I had heard that updating from 10.6.8 may mess up adobe programs and I haven't been able to find my disks for years. So what I learned during this process that it won't mess with my adobe programs AND adobe now allows you to reinstall the programs you have through there website! Yay.
* Git is a lightweight and fast version control software that you download onto your computer and use through the terminal. It is said to be the best that is out there now. Github is an internet website that 'hubs' or holds the files for others to see, download, edit, ect. It is similar to drop box in sense, but for developers.
* Version control is where you can have a file that whoever you choose can have access to, from there these other people can edit the file at the same time as you. No having to save, then send it over, have them send it back ect. You can all work on the file at the same time. What is better is that when you make changes, it will save each change that is made, so if you make a mistake, you can go back.
* Developers use version control because sometimes there is a group working on one file, but these files can be miles long, so everyone can collaberate and work on different parts at the same time, which saves time. Also, really more importantly, is when programming, mistakes happen and they happen a lot. It is wonderful that you can easily just go back instead of having to hit control z a zillion times or try and start over. Of course this makes sense. I used to do a lot of coding to my website with html css and javascript, and it would have been amazing to have been using this the whole time.
* I believe I have a full understanding of this section.

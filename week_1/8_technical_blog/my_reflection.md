Blog url: https://github.com/acreilly/acreilly.github.io/blob/master/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?


Although I just used the layout I have been using, I have seen many blogs on tumblr that have a similar look to my layout. The one page, overflow hidden scroll bar, keep the header in view at all times. I enjoy designing, so yes I did. I don't really enjoy blogging, but thats okay. It is good to do so, like with these reflections, because I can review what I have done and record my experiences along the way.

* I wanted to created transitions on my links for when you hover over them, I used prefixr to create all the browser changes.
* Nothing really.
* I did learn that when using pseudo classes with links that the order of which you write them matters. I only really use hover, and normally don't use :link just leave as is, but it was good to know.
* I am very confident when it comes to my HTML and CSS abilities.
* I enjoyed coding HTML and CSS again. It has been a few months since I am so busy with school and work. I really want to change and complete my website but never have enough time to do so. It was a fun refresh.
* Nothing.

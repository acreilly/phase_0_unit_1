Hello, my name is Allie Reilly. I am fron New Jersey. I chose my favorite websites, just because I use them the most, facebook.com, netflix.com, and nettus.com. My learning style is kinesthetic and visual.

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I am a bit nervous. I know I have the potential, I just hope I don't stuggle, or at least struggle too much, at any point. I really want to do well, so I hope that will be the case. This week has not made me feel better or worse, because it was an easy week. I already know html and css, so all the tasks were very easy. I know that things will change and become much more challenging when we get to ruby.

## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Everything makes sense.
* I know HTML and CSS pretty well. HTML5 and CSS3 I understand but I would need to review and study a bit when it comes to animating and canvas elements.
* I did not know that _blank meant open a new window.

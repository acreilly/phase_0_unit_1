## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Well, now that I have the app its very easy. You click create new repository, give it a name, choose public or private, initialize with a readme, decide on a license and create! Then you go to the app, click your github name, find it, and click clone to computer.
* Open source is where someone can share their code and allow anyone to edit or build upon it. There are different licenses you can assign to your project that will give specific limitations to other's usage. It makes me a little nervous and protective.. I would hate if someone tried to steal my idea, project ect. Even if it is just the idea of it. I guess thats why you can specify the license though. It is neat because you can get others help and feedback which can benefit you and your project as well.
* I think using lisences is very important, and having a good understanding of each and what each entails is important as well. As I said before, it would be terrible if someone stole an idea or project, built upon it and used it for their own benefit (Mark Zuckerberg). Now that can be protected by the licenses.
* I have a good understanding of this section. I will say my somewhat of an aha moment was learning about the licenses. I think that is a great aspect of github and a necessary one. It makes developers feel a little safer about sharing their projects.

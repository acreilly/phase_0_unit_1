## Release 5: Reflection

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
it all worked, didn't have any problems. It was good to learn.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
None

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
I guess I am just wondering, if you have the app, then does it matter if you know how to work with git in the terminal?

I learned in depth how to use git in terminal
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
decently confident, may need to look up references here and there

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
learning in depth
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
nothing

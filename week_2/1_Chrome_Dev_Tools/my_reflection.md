# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
  - The DOM is what allows developers to make websites dynamic. It is the W3C standard for accessing documents and provides structure. In HTML there is a series of objects in the document. These objects have other objects inside of them, creating a tree model. The DOM creates a foundation that allows the creation of events, properties, and methods. I understand it is the  standard for all documents for the web. I guess I knew this before just didn't know it was called the DOM and didn't know all the details, just had a basic knowledge. It seems like the DOM is usually dealing with Javascript. I think it is good to have a standard, but I think it seems to be restricting.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
  - There was a lot of scripting on the wordpress site and it wasn't as easy to play with as the other.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
  - I find it interesting. I think it could definitely be beneficial when wanting to play around with a site to figure out how you want it designed since it updates automatically and doesn't have to be permenent.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
  - It was very intersting to see how chrome dev tools debugs javascript. That can be incredibly helpful when testing scripts.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

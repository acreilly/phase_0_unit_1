# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
  -Well right now I am working almost full time, full time college, and dev bootcamp.. and my fiance likes a lot of attention.. haha. SO, things have been pretty insane for me. I just need to make sure I set aside enough time each week to be able to get everything done efficently and on time.
* How will you combat that? 
  - I already have habits that help me get everything done without going crazy. I'm not exactly sure how to answer this question because it really goes into the next question.
* What techniques will you try?
  - What I do right now is every day I make a to do list. I rewrite it everyday just to keep myself on track with what needs to be done. If projects have a specific deadline, I put it into the calender, and devote my time to the project that is due soonest. Once I complete, or get a large portion done, I move to the next project and so on. I also write myself time limits each day if there are multiple projects. Ill spend 3 hours on one and move to the next. I am specific with my goals for the day like, "write the paragraph on this and this then move onto another project". I make sure that after 10 - 11 ish pm I put it all down and relax.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
  - As of right now, I have devoted a few hours on tuesdays, 1-2 hours wednesday, a decent chunk of thursday, and a few hours on saturday for dev bootcamp. On sunday, I like to review everything I have done, make tweaks, and then submit my projects.

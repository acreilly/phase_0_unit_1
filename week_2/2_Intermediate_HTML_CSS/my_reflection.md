# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. Sometimes they are good if you want something basic and not completely personalized. They make it easy to design and style by setting a specific standard. If you want to get more complex and start from fresh you can just use reset.css
2. Yes. They are the basic layouts for web sites. I've noticed when using the standards though, it sometimes is annoying to position certian elements on the page as you want them, so I always use reset.css
3. Yes. I always use them. They are quicker to write and easier to find on the page.
4. reset.css is necessary when you want to personalize your page comepletely. It helps set things back to 0 and remove the standards that were there. like I said, I always use reset.css
5. I use safari (but I just found out while in DBC it seems to not be used at all...) but I now have been using google chrome(seriously hate it, I had to download an ad blocker, plus it is so slow on my computer) and I've used firefox, but I just find its layout to be unappealing visually. I hate that sites look different on different browsers. I think it is a bad thing, there should be a standard for all browsers so websites can look the same, except when transferring to mobile ect.

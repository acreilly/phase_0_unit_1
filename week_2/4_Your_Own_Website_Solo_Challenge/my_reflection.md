# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://acreilly.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
 -I have heard of user experience design but never quite researched what it was all about. User experience design is how the user feels when visiting and interacting with your website. Is it easy to navigate? visually appealing? working correctly? Fast preformance?
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
  - I went to school for design so yes, I do. It was fun working on the site, I already had the idea in mind for a while, haven't had the time to execute it though until now. It is not exactly what I want, but I have the basic layout down now.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  - I wireframed then coded. I wanted it to be a one page deal, no scrolling down, keeping the body a scroll while the header and footer remain. I was trying to add the awesome fonts for my facebook, linkedin, and github page but unfortunately they wouldn't show up on the page and I couldn't figure out how to get them to.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  - I would like to add the font awesome icons for links. I would like to figure out why it won't show up.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  -I found it relatively easy. I had to research how to add the | between the navigation elements.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

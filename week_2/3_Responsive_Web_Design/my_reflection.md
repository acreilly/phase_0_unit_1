# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. Responsive web design is where a website will respond to a devices size and change accordingly. I like responsive web design, but it can be tedious since you need to edit your pages css for each device size. It is a good practice now a days since everyone uses their tablet, phone ect to access the internet and if it isn't device friendly the website can be difficult to navigate.
2. They have made responsive design. If we did not have smart phones or tablets, I highly doubt responsive design would even be invented. New technology will just make web designers jobs more difficult haha. But seriously, every device seems to have a different size, even if its just a few pixels, and we need to keep up to date. If you really find your website important for the public, you will have each size available and up to date.
3. Well I don't know, it depends in impaired. I mean, if your blind, well, I highly doubt you are using the internet. Other than that, we can adjust font and image sizes now on any website if needed. The web has the ability to read information aloud. Maybe if you're color blind they will create a way to change websites to accomidate your site (maybe they already have? I'm not sure)
4. I believe responsive design is necessary. What I find stupid though is just how every device has a different size, its crazy! the iphone5 is different from iphone4 there is the droid, windows phone ect. I wish they would just create a basic size that all phones tablets would follow, but who am I kidding? If anyone wants to work in technology, you need to be ready for every development and ready to learn and change with it.
